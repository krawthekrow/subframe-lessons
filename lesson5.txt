#title 105: Fun with ARAY

This is a rather difficult activity,
so don't worry if you can't figure
it out without hints.

Make a downward-pointing
permanent BRAY.

In other words,
make this subframe!

You should find that impossible
to do using only the skills
you learnt in Lesson 3.

But you now know enough to
overcome that! Can you see how?

Remember to reload particle order.
Use Shift-F to debug.

#hint
Maybe you could generate the
solid SPRK somewhere else?

Use DRAY to copy a solid SPRK
from elsewhere.

Make sure that the solid SPRK has
life 3 when ARAY is updated!

By default, CONV(PSCN) converts
everything it touches to PSCN.

You can use its tmp to tell it
to only convert SPRKs to PSCN.

To do this, we'll need SPRK's
element ID.

Enter

into the Lua console.

(You can access the Lua console
by pressing '~'.)

The number that appears is SPRK's
element ID.

Now, here's a permanent BRAY setup.
It doesn't work because CONV's tmp
is set to 1 (DUST), so it's not
converting anything.

Set its tmp to SPRK's element ID
and see it spring to life!

Can you make a downward permanent
BRAY smaller than the one you made
in Activity #5.1?

So far, we've been using orange BRAY
for everything.

However, we will soon see that white
BRAY is a lot more useful for subframe.

To make white BRAY, activate ARAY with
any other conductor. Here, we'll use METL.

Notice how the white BRAY refuses to
stay permanent, even though it's
activated by a solid SPRK.

This is because ARAY will not shoot a
BRAY if it sees a BRAY directly in
front of it.

You now know enough to fix this.
Make a permanent white BRAY!

In other words, make this subframe.

#hint
Use DRAY to delete any existing BRAY
before ARAY tries to generate a new one.

#hint
Make sure the DRAY is activated
before the ARAY.
