#section 6.1 Particle Stacks

Multiple particles can occupy the same location.
This is called a "stack".

For example, there is an ARAY underneath this INSL.

You can stack up to 5 particles in the same location.
Any more and it would turn into a BHOL.

#section 6.2 Inspecting Stacks

Normal right-click delete will delete the entire stack.

Instead, use box delete (hold Ctrl down and right-click drag)
to remove just the top "layer" of the stack.

Try it on the INSL-ARAY above to see the hidden ARAY.

Here's another fun stack to "unwrap".

#section 6.3 Stacks in Subframe

In a stack, the visible particle is the topmost one. As you
remove layers, you progress deeper down the stack.

In subframe order, particles in a stack are arranged
from bottom to top.

Here is a stacked permanent BRAY. We want ARAY, CONV then BTRY
to update in that order, so they are arranged that way in the stack.

Let's stack the green CRMC
over the red DMND.

First, arrange them in the order
you want them to appear in the stack.

This means that the green CRMC has to be
to the right of (or below) the red DMND.

Then, reload particle order.

This will ensure that the green CRMC has a
higher ID than the red DMND, so it will go
above the red DMND in the stack.

Mouseover the red DMND and check here
to find its x and y coordinates.

Now, use the PROP tool to set the
green CRMC's coordinates to the
red DMND's coordinates.

To check that you have stacked successfully,
remember to use box delete instead of
normal delete to remove the topmost layer.

#section Activity #6.2

Use a DRAY stack to fill the red box with
green particles in a single frame.
