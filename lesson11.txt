#section 11.1 FILT Data

FILT's ctype contains 30 bits of information.
You can visualize FILT's ctype from its spectrogram.

Mouseover this FILT to see its spectrogram.

You can treat this sequence of bits as a number in binary.
For example, this FILT represents the number 197.

Here's an enlarged view of that FILT's spectrogram.

If you send a BRAY through a FILT, the BRAY picks up the FILT's ctype.
You can also visualize BRAY's ctype from its spectrogram.

#section 11.2 DTEC

DTEC allows you to transfer a BRAY's ctype back to FILT.

Each frame, DTEC searches for BRAYs within a square box.
The search area's size is controlled by DTEC's tmp2.

If DTEC finds a BRAY, it copies the BRAY's ctype
to lines of FILT in all 8 directions.

If DTEC finds multiple BRAYs, it takes the rightmost one.
If there are multiple rightmost BRAYs, it takes the bottommost one.

If you did it right, both FILTs should
have the same color every frame.

Challenge: do the same thing, but only
by adding particles within the blue boxes.
