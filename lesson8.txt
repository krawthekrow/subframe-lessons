#section 8.1 Signal Propagation

Let's say we want this PSCN to control this ARAY.

One idea is to copy the PSCN to the ARAY with DRAY.
SPRK the PSCN. Did it work? (It shouldn't.)

We can debug this by stepping forward frame-by-frame.
Press 'f' to step forward a frame.

Observe that it takes two frames for the signal to reach the ARAY.
By the time the SPRK reaches the ARAY, its life has decreased to 2.

This problem arises because the first DRAY updates after the second DRAY.

#section 8.2 DRAY Wires

There are a number of ways to overcome this problem.

One way is to copy the SPRK downwards first, then rightwards.
This works because the first DRAY updates before the second DRAY.

A more general method is to replace the activating PSCN
(instead of the copied PSCN) in the DRAY-PSCN motif.

Again, this works because the DRAYs update in the correct order.

#section 8.3 Inverting Wires

Another type of DRAY wire is the inverting wire.

Here, we copy a PSCN onto a solid SPRK, deactivating the DRAY.
This transmits and inverts the signal at the same time.

What happens if two wires lead
to the same output?

Here are examples for both normal
and inverting wires.

Play with them by SPRK-ing different
combinations of their inputs.

What do you observe?

These are OR and NOR gates.
