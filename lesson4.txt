#section 4.1 DRAY

DRAY copies particles from one position to another.

Like ARAY, DRAY can operate in different modes depending
on what conductor is used to activate it.

Aside: When a conductor is SPRK'ed, what actually happens is that
the conductor is replaced with a SPRK, and that SPRK's ctype is set
to the conductor's type. Thus, strictly speaking, DRAY looks for an
adjacent SPRK, and chooses its behavior based on the SPRK's ctype.

Here, we'll focus on the PSCN mode. When activated by PSCN,
DRAY will overwrite any particles in the copy destination area.

As a special case, when DRAY "copies" empty space, it simply
deletes any particle in the corresponding destination position.

The number of particles it copies and the place to which
it copies them can be configured via its "tmp" and "tmp2".

SPRK this!

#section 4.2 tmp and tmp2?

Every particle in Powder Toy has a fixed set of properties.
By now, you should be familiar with "ctype" and "life".

"tmp" and "tmp2" are just additional properties a particle can have.
They are intentionally generic: different kinds of particles use them
to store different kinds of per-particle information.

Configure this DRAY so that it copies
the green particles into the red box.

To set the DRAY's tmp/tmp2, use the
PROP tool from the tools menu here.

Select "tmp"/"tmp2", enter the new value,
then click on the DRAY. Mouseover the DRAY;
its tmp/tmp2 should appear here.

Bonus:
Try to get this to work on your first try!

You can sample the coordinates of various
positions under your mouse here.

Use the Lua console (press '~') to quickly
perform subtractions.

#section Activity #4.2

Subframe DRAY works just like subframe ARAY.
See if you can make this subframe!

If you did it right, DRAY would delete WATR
in the copy destination region every frame
instead of every 8 frames.

This would be fast enough that no WATR
would reach the VOID.

Remember to reload particle order!
